### Hallo, Fawaka ğŸ‘‹

<!--
**VirgillP/VirgillP** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ğŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on my COVID-19 data tutorial using the fast and high-level programming language Julia. By building interactive graphs and models one can demonstrate global cases over a period of time and provide key context for epidemic modelling using generic programming.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning about the Julia programming language and would like to specialize in making cool interactive graph that are intuitive too. And yes, I still learning more about C++, because its one of my favourite language. Love Ruby and C too.
- ğŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on open source projects where I get to build fun stuff.
- ğŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with JavaScript ğŸ˜”.
- ğŸ’¬ Ask me about why I love these languages so much.
